- 👋 Hi, I’m @TeemahLwittySwiffyFwarry
- 👀 I’m interested in Software Development and I need great assistance from the proffessional here.
- 🌱 My skills on the Front-End are: HTML, CSS, Javascript, JQuery, Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS, ReactJS and consuming API's.
- My skills on the Back-End development are: SQL database, Python and Django. I'm currently learning nodeJs/Express JS and moving on to nestJs
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on programmers who have more knowledge than I do to guide me.
- 📫 You can reach me on my mail (oladosuoluwayemisi@gmail.com)
